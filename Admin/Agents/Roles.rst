If granted access to the Admin Panel, that Agent will have the ability to make changes in the configurations of the help desk. From the Agent tab of the Admin Panel, the configurations of each Agent of the help desk can be modified, including the ability to Limit an Agentâ€™s access to only tickets that are specifically assigned to them.

The Permissions tab of the Agent profile allows the Agent functionality within the help desk which are not Department specific access items. Areas such as the User Directory, Organization, and Knowledge Base can be limited per Agent. This includes the ability to search for and see the ticket metadata for tickets the Agent does not have access to, the email ban list, and other staff statistics on the dashboard.
