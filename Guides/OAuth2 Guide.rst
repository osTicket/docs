Authorization
-------------

OAuth2 Authorization allows emails the ability to authenticate against a mail server using the OAuth2 protocol. This eliminates the need to store the password locally and instead redirects you directly to the provider to login. Most provider's are phasing out Basic Authentication (username + password) for Modern Authentication (OAuth2) but if you host your own mailserver you may not have OAuth2 available. The most commonly used providers are Microsoft and Google.
